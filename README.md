# 🛍️ Retail coffee shop Sales SQL Project

A simple yet complete SQL project that analyzes sales data using core SQL concepts such as filtering, joining, aggregating, sorting, and working with dates.

## 📁 Dataset

This project uses mock retail data stored across four CSV files:

- `products.csv` — product catalog with prices and categories
- `customers.csv` — customer information
- `city.csv` — city & state details
- `sales.csv` — sales transactions with product, customer, and date references

All CSVs are located in the `/data` folder.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- MySQL 8.0
- MySQL Workbench
- Git & GitHub

## 📊 SQL Concepts Practiced

- `SELECT`, `WHERE` clauses for filtering data
- `ORDER BY` for sorting
- `GROUP BY` with `SUM()`, `COUNT()`
- `INNER JOIN` for combining tables
- Date functions like `MONTH()` and `DATEDIFF()`
- `LIMIT` and `AS` for formatting

## 📜 Project Files

- `scripts/create_tables.sql` — SQL schema to create all tables
- `scripts/load_data.sql` — `LOAD DATA INFILE` statements to import CSVs
- `scripts/analysis_queries.sql` — practice queries solving real-world questions

## 🧠 Example Questions Answered

- What are the top 5 best-selling products?
- Which cities have the highest total sales?
- What’s the number of days since each sale?
- Which customers have made the most purchases?
